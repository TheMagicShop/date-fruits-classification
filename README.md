# Introduction
Every fruit around the world comes in various shapes and varieties, and date is no exception, besides the skin color, morphological features play a great role in determining the type of fruit, in this project we're going to try analyzing and classifying date fruits among 7 available classes,
which are SAFAVI, DOKOL, ROTANA, DEGLET, SOGAY, IRAQI and BERHI, we have a wide range of morphological features captured in the lab using computer vision techniques, we will be trying all sorts of supervised, unsupervised and deep learning, seeking for a better representation of the data to facilitate classification.
